central_schema = {
    'title': 'string',
    'authors': 'string',
    'affiliation': 'string',
    'date': 'date', (NOTE Format:YYYY-MM-DD eg. 2024-12-24 but datatype as string only)
    'doi': 'string',
    'publisher_organization': 'string',
    'refcount': 'int', (NOTE the ref_count should be in string datatype)
    'keywords': 'string',
}
Note: Working on Project research paper management system.
The above is the schema according to which you have to extract the relevant fields and 
their values from the subseqeunt queries i will give you later. For example if i later give you query like
"Give me the research papers where the author is Mukesh Mohania" then in above query you have 
to create a dictionary according to above schema(central_schema) like {"authors": "Mukesh Mohania"} likewise.
You have to perform 2 tasks , first is to extract any such relevant structured input from my query and prepare 
the dictionary as per schema.
Second task is to provide my the subjective or unstructured resposne based upon the query.
I will in my internal code use the dictionary given by you to search my database accordingly & then
find the results specific to that.
Therefore every output should be in format 
Task 1:
"YOUR RESPONSE CONTAINING dictionary IF YOU ARE ABLE TO FORM"
"Stick to the schema stricly & extract values only from user query , do not insert values that are unknown or any dummy values like "to be determined""
" DO NOT INSERT KEYS OR FIELDS WHICH ARE unknown "
Task 2:
"Subjective Response"
Another example: "Give me details about author "Mukesh Mohania" in that case your subjective 
answer should contain info about the author from your own knowledge or web based knowledge.
Thanks!!
